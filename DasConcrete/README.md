A program for automatically creating concrete.
Requires a mining turtle with a crafting upgrade placed in front of an air block with water nearby and a chest above the turtle for buffering items.
Commands for creating concrete are run by specifying a dye name (the dye name minus minecraft: or _dye) and a quantity.
The generated file dasConcrete.config can be modified to change the inventory names for gravel, sand, dyes, and output although the default is input on the left and output on the back of the turtle.
The buffer inventory should always be above the turtle.
